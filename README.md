### NPSP-Year-End-Receipts
Approaches to solving the Year End Receipts task

However, their posts led me to a workaround solution that has worked really well, and I wanted to share in case it can help others.

It involves Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and a Word Add-in. The add-in was created by Microsoft super-user Graham Mayor, so use at your own risk. However, I researched a little, and he seems like a gentleman whose only wish is to help others get the most out of Microsoft, and the add-in has been working great for me. The add-in is called “Many to One” and can be found here: [Many to One](http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm). It essentially takes the Excel data source that is behind the Directory Mail Merge and puts it in a program that runs with a few clicks.

While working through this, I took a couple of notes that will hopefully make the whole process go smoothly for you:
- Definitely read over everything first, follow the instructions and watch this Youtube tutorial before starting: [Many to One Tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgKgP_n02J4)

- I’d also recommend starting off with a small sample set of your data, just to get a feel for it, and create a new folder somewhere on your computer for the files to live.
